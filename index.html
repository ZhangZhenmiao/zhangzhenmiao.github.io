                    Recent large-scale genome sequencing projects have aimed to generate near-complete diploid
                    assemblies that reconstruct both haplomes. Producing such assemblies remains a formidable task,
                    typically requiring large teams, extensive manual analysis, and the integration of multiple
                    sequencing technologies, including PacBio high-fidelity (HiFi) reads, Oxford Nanopore reads,
                    Illumina Hi-C data, Illumina parent-child trios, and Bionano optical maps. Despite these efforts,
                    the downstream applications of near-complete diploid assemblies for non-human genomes have so far
                    been limited. For many species, a near-complete haplotype-mixed assembly—representing a mosaic of
                    two haplomes—provides many of the same benefits for downstream analyses as a near-complete diploid
                    assembly. Such assemblies can be generated automatically at lower cost using only HiFi reads. Here
                    we present Mosaic Genome Assembler (MAG), a tool that generates near-complete haplotype-mixed
                    assemblies using only HiFi reads. We show that MAG substantially outperforms existing
                    haplotype-mixed assemblers.

                    Metagenomic binning is crucial for reconstructing microbial genomes from metagenomic sequencing
                    samples. However, existing tools struggle in complex communities where short, low-abundance contigs
                    predominate, thereby limiting the recovery of complete metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and the
                    identification of novel functions. Here, we introduce CompleteBin, a Transformer-based framework
                    that integrates contig sequence context, pre-trained taxonomic embeddings from a genome language
                    model, and dynamic contrastive learning to bin short contigs robustly. Across CAMI II datasets,
                    CompleteBin increased near-complete MAG recovery by 38.5% over leading methods like COMEBin. Across
                    diverse real-world datasets (marine, freshwater, plant-associated, cold seep sediment, and human
                    gut), it achieved a 57.4% improvement on average. Applying CompleteBin to six cold seep sediment
                    samples uncovered 129 strain-level genome bins across 30 phyla, including 13 phyla undetected by
                    other tools, and taxonomically assigned 90,405 genes (32.1% of total), revealing previously unknown
                    species in nitrogen and sulfur cycling. CompleteBin unlocks microbial dark matter in diverse
                    environments, advancing our understanding of microbial ecology and biogeochemical processes.

                    The human gut microbiota exhibits significant diversity across populations, influenced by factors
                    such as geography, diet, and lifestyle, particularly between the Han Chinese and non-Chinese
                    populations. While previous studies have predominantly focused on the taxonomic abundance of the gut
                    microbiome, the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in driving population-specific
                    differences remains largely underexplored.<br>

                    In this study, we systematically investigated gut microbial differences between the Han Chinese and
                    non-Chinese populations using the Human Gut Microbiome Reference Genome Catalog (HGMRGC). HGMRGC
                    includes 271,480 non-redundant genomes from 5,785 prokaryotic species, which was generated by
                    metagenomic sequencing data from 9,320 publicly available samples across 22 countries and 3,584
                    newly sequenced samples from Han Chinese individuals across 29 provinces and regions in China.<br>

                    We observed geography was the primary driver of microbial variation of abundance and SNPs. We
                    identified 625 novel population-specific genome clusters from HGMRGC with functional differences in
                    carbohydrate utilization and 126 species exhibiting distinct prevalence related to vitamin
                    biosynthesis, antibiotic resistance, and carbohydrate metabolism. Beta diversity analysis
                    highlighted significant inter-population differences in both microbial abundance and SNPs, while
                    alpha diversity analysis revealed that non-Chinese populations exhibited higher diversity in
                    microbial abundance, and Han Chinese populations displayed greater diversity in SNPs. These results
                    provide valuable insights into population-specific microbial diversity, laying the groundwork for
                    future research on its functional and health implications.

                    The most dynamic and repetitive regions of great ape genomes have traditionally been excluded from
                    comparative studies1,2,3. Consequently, our understanding of the evolution of our species is
                    incomplete.
                    Here we present haplotype-resolved reference genomes and comparative analyses of six ape species:
                    chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, Bornean orangutan, Sumatran orangutan and siamang. We achieve
                    chromosome-level contiguity with substantial sequence accuracy (&lt1 error in 2.7 megabases) and
                    completely sequence 215 gapless chromosomes telomere-to-telomere. We resolve challenging regions,
                    such as the major histocompatibility complex and immunoglobulin loci, to provide in-depth
                    evolutionary insights. Comparative analyses enabled investigations of the evolution and diversity of
                    regions previously uncharacterized or incompletely studied without bias from mapping to the human
                    reference genome. Such regions include newly minted gene families in lineage-specific segmental
                    duplications, centromeric DNA, acrocentric chromosomes and subterminal heterochromatin. This
                    resource serves as a comprehensive baseline for future evolutionary studies of humans and our

                    <strong>Motivation</strong>
                    The emergence of the ‘telomere-to-telomere’ genomics brought the challenge of identifying segmental
                    duplications (SDs) in complete genomes. It further opened a possibility for identifying the
                    differences
                    in SDs across individual human genomes and studying the SD evolution. These newly emerged challenges
                    require algorithms for reconstructing SDs in the most complex genomic regions that evaded all
                    previous
                    attempts to analyze their architecture, such as rapidly evolving immunoglobulin loci.<br>

                    <strong>Results</strong>
                    We describe the GenomeDecoder algorithm for inferring SDs and apply it to analyzing genomic
                    architectures of various loci in primate genomes. Our analysis revealed that multiple
                    duplications/deletions led to a rapid birth/death of immunoglobulin genes within the human
                    population
                    and large changes in genomic architecture of immunoglobulin loci across primate genomes. Comparison
                    of
                    immunoglobulin loci across primate genomes suggests that they are subjected to diversifying
                    selection.<br>

                    Although long-read sequencing enables the generation of complete genomes for unculturable microbes,
                    its high cost limits the widespread adoption of long-read sequencing in large-scale metagenomic
                    studies. An alternative method is to assemble short-reads with long-range connectivity, which can be
                    a cost-effective way to generate high-quality microbial genomes. Here, we develop Pangaea, a
                    bioinformatic approach designed to enhance metagenome assembly using short-reads with long-range
                    connectivity. Pangaea leverages connectivity derived from physical barcodes of linked-reads or
                    virtual barcodes by aligning short-reads to long-reads. Pangaea utilizes a deep learning-based read
                    binning algorithm to assemble co-barcoded reads exhibiting similar sequence contexts and abundances,
                    thereby improving the assembly of high- and medium-abundance microbial genomes. Pangaea also
                    leverages a multi-thresholding algorithm strategy to refine assembly for low-abundance microbes. We
                    benchmark Pangaea on linked-reads and a combination of short- and long-reads from simulation data,
                    mock communities and human gut metagenomes. Pangaea achieves significantly higher contig continuity
                    as well as more near-complete metagenome-assembled genomes (NCMAGs) than the existing assemblers.
                    Pangaea also generates three complete and circular NCMAGs on the human gut microbiomes.

                    Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) offer valuable insights into the exploration of microbial dark
                    matter using metagenomic sequencing data. However, there is growing concern that contamination in
                    MAGs may substantially affect the results of downstream analysis. Current MAG decontamination tools
                    primarily rely on marker genes and do not fully use the contextual information of genomic sequences.
                    To overcome this limitation, we introduce Deepurify for MAG decontamination. Deepurify uses a

                    their taxonomic lineages. It allocates contigs within a MAG to a MAG-separated tree and applies a

                    high- and medium-quality sub-MAGs. Here we show that Deepurify outperformed MDMclearer and MAGpurify
                    on simulated data, CAMI datasets and real-world datasets with varying complexities. Deepurify
                    increased the number of high-quality MAGs by 20.0% in soil, 45.1% in ocean, 45.5% in plants, 33.8%
                    in freshwater and 28.5% in human faecal metagenomic sequencing datasets.

                    <strong>Background</strong><br>
                    Linked-read sequencing technologies generate high-base quality short reads that contain
                    extrapolative information on long-range DNA connectedness. These advantages of linked-read
                    technologies are well known and have been demonstrated in many human genomic and metagenomic
                    studies. However, existing linked-read analysis pipelines (e.g., Long Ranger) were primarily
                    developed to process sequencing data from the human genome and are not suited for analyzing
                    metagenomic sequencing data. Moreover, linked-read analysis pipelines are typically limited to 1
                    specific sequencing platform.<br>

                    <strong>Findings</strong><br>
                    To address these limitations, we present the Linked-Read ToolKit (LRTK), a unified and versatile
                    toolkit for platform agnostic processing of linked-read sequencing data from both human genome and
                    metagenome. LRTK provides functions to perform linked-read simulation, barcode sequencing error
                    correction, barcode-aware read alignment and metagenome assembly, reconstruction of long DNA
                    fragments, taxonomic classification and quantification, and barcode-assisted genomic variant calling
                    and phasing. LRTK has the ability to process multiple samples automatically and provides users with
                    the option to generate reproducible reports during processing of raw sequencing data and at multiple
                    checkpoints throughout downstream analysis. We applied LRTK on linked reads from simulation, mock
                    community, and real datasets for both human genome and metagenome. We showcased LRTK’s ability to
                    generate comparative performance results from preceding benchmark studies and to report these
                    results in publication-ready HTML document plots.<br>

                    <strong>Conclusions</strong><br>
                    LRTK provides comprehensive and flexible modules along with an easy-to-use Python-based workflow for
                    processing linked-read sequencing datasets, thereby filling the current gap in the field caused by
                    platform-centric genome-specific linked-read data analysis tools.

                    Metagenome assembly is an efficient approach to reconstruct microbial genomes from metagenomic
                    sequencing data. Although short-read sequencing has been widely used for metagenome assembly,
                    linked- and long-read sequencing have shown their advancements in assembly by providing long-range
                    DNA connectedness. Many metagenome assembly tools were developed to simplify the assembly graphs and
                    resolve the repeats in microbial genomes. However, there remains no comprehensive evaluation of
                    metagenomic sequencing technologies, and there is a lack of practical guidance on selecting the
                    appropriate metagenome assembly tools. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark of 19 commonly
                    used assembly tools applied to metagenomic sequencing datasets obtained from simulation, mock
                    communities or human gut microbiomes. These datasets were generated using mainstream sequencing
                    platforms, such as Illumina and BGISEQ short-read sequencing, 10x Genomics linked-read sequencing,
                    and PacBio and Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing. The assembly tools were extensively evaluated
                    against many criteria, which revealed that long-read assemblers generated high contig contiguity but
                    failed to reveal some medium- and high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Linked-read
                    assemblers obtained the highest number of overall near-complete MAGs from the human gut microbiomes.
                    Hybrid assemblers using both short- and long-read sequencing were promising methods to improve both
                    total assembly length and the number of near-complete MAGs. This paper also discussed the running
                    time and peak memory consumption of these assembly tools and provided practical guidance on
                    selecting them.

                    <strong>Background</strong><br>
                    Due to the complexity of microbial communities, de novo assembly on next generation sequencing data
                    is commonly unable to produce complete microbial genomes. Metagenome assembly binning becomes an
                    essential step that could group the fragmented contigs into clusters to represent microbial genomes
                    based on contigs’ nucleotide compositions and read depths. These features work well on the long
                    contigs, but are not stable for the short ones. Contigs can be linked by sequence overlap (assembly
                    graph) or by the paired-end reads aligned to them (PE graph), where the linked contigs have high
                    chance to be derived from the same clusters.<br>

                    <strong>Results</strong><br>
                    We developed METAMVGL, a multi-view graph-based metagenomic contig binning algorithm by integrating
                    both assembly and PE graphs. It could strikingly rescue the short contigs and correct the binning
                    errors from dead ends. METAMVGL learns the two graphs’ weights automatically and predicts the contig
                    labels in a uniform multi-view label propagation framework. In experiments, we observed METAMVGL
                    made use of significantly more high-confidence edges from the combined graph and linked dead ends to
                    the main graph. It also outperformed many state-of-the-art contig binning algorithms, including
                    MaxBin2, MetaBAT2, MyCC, CONCOCT, SolidBin and GraphBin on the metagenomic sequencing data from
                    simulation, two mock communities and Sharon infant fecal samples.<br>

                    <strong>Conclusions</strong><br>
                    Our findings demonstrate METAMVGL outstandingly improves the short contig binning and outperforms
                    the other existing contig binning tools on the metagenomic sequencing data from simulation, mock
                    communities and infant fecal samples.
